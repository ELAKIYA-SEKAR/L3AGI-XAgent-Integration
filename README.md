# L3AGI-XAgent-Integration

The L3AGI framework is a robust system designed to execute advanced artificial intelligence tasks through the coordinated efforts of multiple agents. This report outlines the integration of the XAgent into the L3AGI framework, replacing the previously employed Langchain REACT Agent. The primary objective of this integration was to leverage the advanced capabilities of XAgent to enhance the framework's overall performance, while simultaneously ensuring a smooth transition and preserving existing system functionalities.
